# Tableau Dashboard Collection

Welcome to Charlotte's Tableau Dashboard collection! This repository contains a series of Tableau projects showcasing different data analyses and visualizations across a variety of topics.

## Contents

Each folder within this repository represents a distinct Tableau dashboard. You can explore each dashboardâ€™s unique insights and visualizations by browsing the corresponding folders. Each folder contains:
- **Dashboard PDF**: A static snapshot of the dashboard for offline viewing.
- **Interactive Link**: A Tableau Public link for an interactive experience (if available).

## How to Browse

1. **Explore Folders**: Navigate to individual folders to view each dashboard's theme and content.
2. **View PDF Snapshots**: Open PDF files in each folder for a detailed, static view of the dashboards.
3. **Interact Online**: Use the Tableau Public links to interact with the dashboards directly (when available).

Thank you for checking out my Tableau Dashboard collection! Feel free to reach out if you have questions or feedback about any of the dashboards.
