# Employee Attrition Analysis

This project aims to analyze employee attrition using a comprehensive dataset to uncover key insights and provide actionable recommendations. The dataset contains information about employee demographics, job satisfaction, salary, and attrition status. The goal of this analysis is to help the company understand the factors influencing employee turnover and to develop strategies for improving retention.

## Project Overview

In this analysis, we used data visualization and statistical techniques to examine various factors related to employee attrition. The key objectives of this analysis are:

- Identify the distribution of employee ages and its impact on attrition.
- Analyze job satisfaction across different departments and job titles.
- Examine the relationship between monthly working hours and employee turnover.
- Investigate promotion rates in different departments and job roles.
- Assess the influence of salary levels on attrition rates.
- Explore generational differences in attrition behavior.
- Provide actionable recommendations based on the findings.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this analysis is a synthetic employee dataset sourced from Kaggle, designed to mimic real-world employee data. The dataset includes the following columns:

- **Age**: The age of the employee.
- **Gender**: The gender of the employee.
- **Department**: The department where the employee works (e.g., Sales, Marketing).
- **Job Title**: The job title of the employee (e.g., Engineer, Manager).
- **Years at Company**: The number of years the employee has worked at the company.
- **Satisfaction Level**: The employee's satisfaction score (0-1 scale).
- **Average Monthly Hours**: The average number of hours the employee works per month.
- **Promotion Last 5 Years**: Indicates if the employee was promoted in the last 5 years (0 or 1).
- **Salary**: The annual salary of the employee.
- **Attrition**: Indicates if the employee has left the company (0 for stayed, 1 for left).

## Key Findings

### 1. Age Distribution
We found that employee ages range from 25 to 59 years, with a fairly even distribution. The largest age group is 59, indicating a mature workforce.

### 2. Job Satisfaction by Department and Job Title
The analysis revealed that the Sales department has the highest job satisfaction, while Finance has the lowest. Managers reported lower satisfaction compared to other job titles, such as accountants.

### 3. Monthly Working Hours
The distribution of average monthly hours shows that many employees work significantly more than the standard 173 hours per month. This may suggest a high workload and could be linked to increased attrition rates.

### 4. Promotion Rates
Promotion rates vary across departments, with the Sales department showing the highest promotion rates, while Finance and Engineering have the lowest.

### 5. Salary and Attrition
A clear trend was observed where employees with lower salaries showed higher attrition rates. Medium and high-salary employees were more likely to stay with the company, suggesting that competitive compensation plays a key role in retention.

### 6. Generational Differences in Attrition
The analysis indicated that Gen Z employees are the most loyal to the company, while Millennials have the highest attrition rates. Gen X falls between these two extremes.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we suggest the following recommendations:

1. **Improve Job Satisfaction**: Regularly assess employee satisfaction and address concerns, especially in departments with low scores like Finance.
2. **Enhance Compensation Strategies**: Adjust salary structures to ensure competitive compensation, particularly for lower-salary roles, to reduce turnover.
3. **Promote Work-Life Balance**: Implement policies to manage employee workload and maintain a balanced number of working hours per month.
4. **Encourage Career Growth**: Provide more promotion opportunities and career development programs to increase employee engagement and reduce attrition.
